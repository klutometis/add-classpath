Our benevolent dictator, Rich Hickey, [[http://clojure.github.com/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/add-classpath][deprecated]] add-classpath; let's

[[https://github.com/richhickey/clojure-contrib/blob/a1c66df5287776b4397cf3929a5f498fbb34ea32/src/main/clojure/clojure/contrib/java_utils.clj#L208][wall-hack-method]] and Jimmy Life's [[http://jimlife.wordpress.com/2007/12/19/java-adding-new-classpath-at-runtime/][URLClassLoader hack]].
